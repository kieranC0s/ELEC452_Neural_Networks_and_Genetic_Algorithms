# Assignment 1: Perceptrons

Emotion classification using a perceptron model. It showcases the implementation of simple feedback learning, with a focus on adjusting weights based on feedback information. The project uses a dataset from Kaggle and includes a custom-built evaluator function using PyTorch or Numpy. Key components of the project are the training and evaluation of the perceptron model, with evaluation metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. The repository contains code for model training, prediction, and performance evaluation, demonstrating practical applications of machine learning in emotion recognition.

# Assignment 2: Multi Layer Perceptron Network

The project involves developing a neural network with backpropagation for binary classification on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. Key features include custom network architecture with sigmoid activation, forward and backward propagation functions, and performance evaluation metrics. It showcases skills in basic machine learning algorithm development and understanding of neural network fundamentals.

# Assignment 3: Principle Component Analysis

Unsupervised learning techniques like PCA and K-Means Clustering. The first part employs PCA for dimensionality reduction in sound data, and the second part utilizes K-Means for clustering a penguin dataset. The project highlights the use of Numpy for model building and evaluation, demonstrating an in-depth understanding of these key machine learning algorithms.

# Assignment 4: Genetic Algorithm

Covers topics in neural networks and genetic algorithms. It includes theoretical analyses and practical implementations covering selection methods, schema theory, mutation probabilities, and a hands-on genetic algorithm project with various experimental setups and performance evaluations.

# Assignment 5: Email Phising Detection Final Project

The "Phishing Email Detection" project presents an extensive study and implementation of a phishing detection system using LSTM neural networks. The project, guided by Prof. Hossein, involves the collaboration of Kieran Cosgrove, Lucas Coster, and Mile Stosic. The report covers the motivation, problem description, related work, dataset, and individual contributions in detail. Central to the project is the implementation of an LSTM-based neural network, complemented by dropout layers to prevent overfitting, ensuring generalizability on unseen data. The model, rigorously tested on a Kaggle-sourced dataset, showcases a high accuracy of 97.5%, underlining its effectiveness. The report also includes a discussion on the results, providing insights into the model's performance metrics and potential future enhancements.
